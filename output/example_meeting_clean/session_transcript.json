I'm usually in bed around midnight, but I wake up once or twice. I'm getting about six hours, which leaves me tired in the afternoon. Got it. And how's your activity? Pretty low. I walk maybe 3,000 steps on weekdays, but I'd like to build a routine, maybe morning walks. Great. We can turn that into a clear goal.",
